Description: Documenting how a dataset was generated increases reproducibility.
  In addition, documentation for dataset generation can serve as a template for
  people to create their own datasets in a similar structure, serving as a way
  to bootstrap new analyses. R packages often use the data-raw directory to 
  create datasets, but do not have an easy mechanism for importing those creation
  steps into dataset documentation. {exdata} provides a new roxygen2 tag to
  automatically copy over the dataset generation code from the scripts that
  create the dataset into the documentation for the dataset.
